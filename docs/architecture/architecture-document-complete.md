# Architecture Document Complete

This comprehensive architecture document defines eventRunner's complete technical foundation using the T3 Stack approach. The architecture provides:

- **Type-safe fullstack development** with TypeScript, tRPC, and Convex
- **Modern deployment strategy** optimized for Vercel and edge computing
- **Scalable real-time features** via Supabase for collaboration
- **Comprehensive security model** with Clerk authentication and Convex authorization
- **Developer-friendly experience** with excellent tooling and testing strategies
- **Production-ready monitoring** and error handling

The T3 Stack choice significantly simplifies the architecture compared to the original microservices approach while maintaining all the powerful features required by the PRD, making it ideal for rapid development and deployment of eventRunner's complex business requirements.
