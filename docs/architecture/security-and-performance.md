# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: Strict content security policy preventing XSS
- XSS Prevention: React's built-in XSS protection + input sanitization
- Secure Storage: HTTP-only cookies for sessions, secure local storage for non-sensitive data

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Zod schema validation on all tRPC procedures
- Rate Limiting: Vercel's built-in rate limiting + custom middleware for API abuse prevention
- CORS Policy: Strict CORS configuration for API endpoints

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: Secure session management via Convex Auth
- Session Management: JWT tokens with secure refresh rotation
- Password Policy: OAuth-first approach, secure fallback for email/password

**Database Security:**
- Connection Security: Built-in security with Convex serverless architecture
- Row Level Security: Function-level access control with Convex Auth
- Data Encryption: Encryption at rest and in transit via Convex, sensitive data hashing

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: < 200KB initial bundle via Next.js automatic splitting
- Loading Strategy: React Suspense + lazy loading for route-based code splitting
- Caching Strategy: React Query caching + Next.js static generation where possible

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: < 200ms API response time for 95th percentile
- Database Optimization: Convex automatic query optimization + built-in indexes
- Caching Strategy: Convex built-in caching + React Query for client-side optimistic updates

**Real-time Performance:**
- Real-time Optimization: Convex real-time subscriptions with automatic optimization
- State Synchronization: Convex optimistic updates with automatic conflict resolution
- Memory Management: Automatic subscription cleanup via Convex
