# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **eventRunner**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach uses the **T3 Stack** methodology, combining Next.js, TypeScript, tRPC, Convex, Tailwind CSS, and Convex Auth to create a modern, type-safe, and developer-friendly fullstack application optimized for event venue businesses.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision:** Greenfield project using Create T3 App as the foundation with Convex integration
- **Template:** [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and tRPC, then integrate Convex for database and authentication
- **Rationale:** T3 Stack provides excellent type safety, developer experience, and rapid development capabilities. Convex integration adds serverless database, real-time capabilities, and enhanced security perfect for the complex CRM and project management features required by eventRunner
