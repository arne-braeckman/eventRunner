# User Interface Design Goals

This section captures the high-level UI/UX vision for `eventRunner` to guide the Design Architect and inform subsequent story creation, focusing on product vision and user goals rather than granular UI specifications.

* **Overall UX Vision:** The primary UX vision for `eventRunner` is to provide a highly intuitive, seamless, and efficient experience that "unburdens" event venue owners and their staff, allowing them to feel "in control" and operate professionally. The interface should simplify complex workflows, foster clear communication, and enable users to focus on running successful events rather than managing fragmented tools.
* **Key Interaction Paradigms:** The system will prominently feature **drag-and-drop functionality** for core modules like the CRM pipeline (FR2) and Kanban project boards (FR6), enabling intuitive management of opportunities and tasks. **Real-time chat functionality** (FR6/FR15) will be central to post-agreement collaboration, supported by **collaborative rich-text editing** capabilities within the chat.
* **Core Screens and Views:** The application will include key views and screens such as:
    * A **main navigation sidebar** for core modules (Contact Management, CRM, Documents, Payments, Projects/Portal, Analytics).
    * **Contact detail views** displaying customer journey, interests, and activity timelines.
    * Dedicated **CRM & Kanban boards** for pipeline and project management.
    * A **document modal** for template selection, preview, and e-signature workflow.
    * **Integrated payment pop-ups** and confirmation flows.
    * Specialized **collaborative project spaces** (FR6), including chat panels, document areas, and Kanban boards.
    * **User profile and settings** for team management, roles, templates, integrations.
    * A **notifications panel** with configurable alerts (FR9).
    * A central **analytics dashboard** for sales, payments, and Kanban metrics (FR11).
    * An **onboarding wizard** pop-up for first-time users and clients (FR10).
* **Accessibility:** The system should aim for a basic level of web accessibility compliance to ensure usability for a broad audience. Specific compliance standards (e.g., WCAG AA) to be defined.
* **Branding:** The system should allow for customer branding within the client-facing project workspace (FR6) and potentially overall tool branding, as defined in FR7. Specific brand guidelines (color palette, typography) to be defined.
* **Target Device and Platforms:** The application is envisioned as a **web-based app with responsive design for desktop and mobile**.
