## Background Context

The event management landscape often presents small to medium-sized venue businesses with fragmented software solutions that are typically designed for large enterprises. This leads to inefficiencies in managing the complete customer journey, from initial contact through to project delivery and payment collection. `eventRunner` addresses this challenge by providing an integrated, all-in-one web application that consolidates CRM, document management, payments, and collaborative project delivery.

The primary need for `eventRunner` stems from the desire to empower venue owners and their teams to transcend operational complexities. By offering powerful feature integration, intuitive design, and built-in automation, the platform aims to free up valuable time, allowing businesses to concentrate on selling and executing successful events rather than navigating disparate tools.
