## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 2.1, the foundation has been established with:

- Enhanced Contact model with leadHeatScore, socialProfiles, customFields, and interaction tracking [Source: 2.1 completion notes]
- Comprehensive social media API integrations for Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn
- Lead heat calculation system with configurable scoring algorithm
- Interactive dashboard and pipeline interfaces with drag-and-drop functionality

### Implementation Notes

**API Integration Limitations:** Task 1 (Google Analytics 4 API Integration) and Task 4 (Email Communication System) are marked ON HOLD due to current development team API integration constraints. These tasks will be implemented after core user story development is complete. The story can proceed with Tasks 2, 3, and 5 which focus on data model enhancements, UI improvements, and customer journey stage management.

### Data Models

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: ✅ EXCELLENT IMPLEMENTATION**

The implementation demonstrates senior-level development practices with comprehensive feature delivery, proper architecture, and excellent code organization. The developer successfully implemented all deliverable tasks (2, 3, and 5) with attention to detail, type safety, and extensibility.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive data model design with proper indexing strategy
- Clean TypeScript interfaces with proper type definitions
- Well-structured component architecture following React best practices
- Sophisticated business logic engine for automated progression rules
- Excellent test coverage with meaningful assertions
- Proper error handling and validation throughout

### Refactoring Performed

During the review, I identified and fixed several inconsistencies and improvements:

- **File**: `src/lib/types/contact.ts`
  - **Change**: Updated `InteractionType` union type to include all 14 new interaction types from schema
  - **Why**: Critical type inconsistency between schema and TypeScript definitions could cause runtime errors
  - **How**: Added missing interaction types (EMAIL_SENT, EMAIL_OPENED, etc.) and extended INTERACTION_TYPE_OPTIONS with proper weight assignments

- **File**: `src/components/features/contacts/ContactJourneyStage.tsx`
  - **Change**: Improved progress bar connector layout from absolute positioning to proper flex layout
  - **Why**: Previous hardcoded positioning (ml-12 mt-2) could cause layout issues on different screen sizes
  - **How**: Replaced with relative positioning and proper connector elements for better responsive design
