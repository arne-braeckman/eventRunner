## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1 completion notes:

- Basic lead capture form already implemented with LeadCaptureForm component
- Contact model exists in Convex schema with proper enumerations
- Contacts page already created but needs enhancement beyond basic form
- Navigation system in place with role-based menu items
- Authentication and authorization system fully functional

### Data Models

**Contact Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Contact]

- Core entity for lead management
- Required fields: name, email, leadSource, leadHeat, status
- Status enumeration: UNQUALIFIED, PROSPECT, LEAD, QUALIFIED, CUSTOMER, LOST
- LeadSource enumeration: WEBSITE, FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, LINKEDIN, REFERRAL, DIRECT, OTHER
- Optional fields: phone, company, notes, assignedTo
- Timestamps: createdAt, updatedAt

**Existing Contact Interface from Convex Schema:**

```typescript
interface Contact {
  _id: Id<"contacts">;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phone?: string;
  company?: string;
  leadSource:
    | "WEBSITE"
    | "FACEBOOK"
    | "INSTAGRAM"
    | "LINKEDIN"
    | "REFERRAL"
    | "DIRECT"
    | "OTHER";
  leadHeat: "COLD" | "WARM" | "HOT";
  status:
    | "UNQUALIFIED"
    | "PROSPECT"
    | "LEAD"
    | "QUALIFIED"
    | "CUSTOMER"
    | "LOST";
  notes?: string;
  assignedTo?: Id<"users">;
  createdAt: number;
  updatedAt: number;
}
```

### API Specifications

**tRPC Router Structure** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#tRPC]

- Located in `src/server/api/routers/`
- Contact router: contact.ts with create, read operations
- Protected procedures require authentication middleware
- Must extend existing contact.ts router with new functionality

**Existing Convex Functions** [Source: Story 1.1 completion notes]

- `createContact` mutation - already implemented
- `getAllContacts` query - already implemented
- `getContactByEmail` query - already implemented
- `updateContactStatus` mutation - already implemented
- `assignContact` mutation - already implemented

**New Functions Needed:**

- `getContactById` query for detail view
- `searchContacts` query with search and filter parameters
- `updateContact` mutation for editing contact information
- Pagination support in getAllContacts query

### Component Specifications

**Form Components** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component]

- Use react-hook-form for form handling
- Located in `src/components/forms/`
- Follow component template with TypeScript interfaces
- Use shadcn/ui base components

**Contact Management Module** [Source: architecture/components.md#Contact-Management-Module]

- Contact list with filtering and search
- Contact detail view with interaction timeline
- Lead heat visualization
- Dependencies: tRPC contact router, Convex Contact model
- Technology Stack: React Server Components, shadcn/ui, Zustand for UI state

### Data Flow Architecture

**Component → Data Pattern:**

```typescript
// Use direct Convex queries/mutations (recommended for real-time)
const contacts = useQuery(api.contacts.getAllContacts);
const updateContact = useMutation(api.contacts.updateContact);

// NOT through tRPC layer (tRPC used for business logic endpoints only)
```

**Real-time Updates Implementation:**

- Convex provides automatic reactivity - components re-render on data changes
- Use optimistic updates for edit operations with proper error handling
- No additional WebSocket setup required - Convex handles this automatically
- Handle concurrent edit conflicts by refreshing data on mutation errors

**State Management Scope:**

- Convex handles all server state (contacts data, real-time updates)
- Local state needed for: search filters, pagination offset, edit modes, selected items
- Consider URL state for shareable filtered views (e.g., `?search=john&status=LEAD`)
- Use Zustand only for complex UI state that needs cross-component sharing

**CSV Export Architecture:**

- Client-side generation using native JavaScript (no external library needed for basic CSV)
- Data transformation pipeline: Filter → Map → CSV stringify → Download
- Memory considerations: Process in chunks for large datasets (>1000 contacts)
- File naming convention: `contacts-export-${timestamp}.csv`
- Export filtered results based on current view state

### File Locations

### Technical Constraints

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Next.js 15.x with App Router
- TypeScript 5.x for type safety
- Convex for database and real-time features
- shadcn/ui for component library

**Environment Configuration** [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

- Use existing Convex deployment configuration
- Real-time subscriptions through Convex
- Authentication through existing Clerk integration

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Always use TypeScript interfaces, never `any` type
- All API endpoints through tRPC routers with input validation
- Never query database directly from components
- Check user permissions in protected tRPC procedures
- Use Convex real-time subscriptions, not polling
- Component naming: PascalCase (e.g., `ContactList.tsx`)
- Hook naming: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useContacts.ts`)
