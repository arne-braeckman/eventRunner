# Story 1.1: Core Foundation Setup

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** development team,
**I want** to establish the foundational T3 Stack infrastructure with Convex database and Clerk authentication,
**so that** we have a working local development environment with basic user management and lead capture capabilities.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This is the first story, so no previous insights exist.

### Data Models

**User Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#User]

- Uses Convex Auth for authentication management
- Role enumeration: ADMIN, SALES, PROJECT_MANAGER, STAFF, CLIENT
- Required fields: email (unique), name, role
- Optional fields: image, emailVerified

**Contact Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Contact]

- Core entity for lead management
- Required fields: name, email, leadSource, leadHeat, status
- Status enumeration: UNQUALIFIED, PROSPECT, LEAD, QUALIFIED, CUSTOMER, LOST
- LeadSource enumeration: WEBSITE, FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, LINKEDIN, REFERRAL, DIRECT, OTHER

### API Specifications

**tRPC Router Structure** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#tRPC]

- Located in `src/server/api/routers/`
- Contact router: contact.ts with create, read operations
- User router: user.ts with role management
- Protected procedures require authentication middleware

### Component Specifications

**Form Components** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component]

- Use react-hook-form for form handling
- Located in `src/components/forms/`
- Follow component template with TypeScript interfaces
- Use shadcn/ui base components

### File Locations

**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

- Convex schema: `convex/schema.ts`
- Convex functions: `convex/`
- Next.js app: `src/app/`
- Components: `src/components/`
- tRPC routers: `src/server/api/routers/`
- Auth config: `convex/auth.config.ts`

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Unit tests with Vitest + React Testing Library
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Backend tests for tRPC procedures
- Test files location: `tests/` directory
- Component tests: `tests/components/`
- API tests: `tests/api/`

### Technical Constraints

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Next.js 15.x with App Router
- TypeScript 5.x for type safety
- Convex for database and real-time features
- Convex Auth for authentication
- Tailwind CSS 3.x for styling
- shadcn/ui for component library

**Environment Configuration** [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

- Convex deployment configuration: `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`
- OAuth provider configuration: `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`, `AUTH_GITHUB_ID`, `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET`
- Email service configuration: `AUTH_RESEND_KEY`
- Environment variables must be configured before running `convex dev`

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Always use TypeScript interfaces, never `any` type
- All API endpoints through tRPC routers with input validation
- Never query database directly from components
- Check user permissions in protected tRPC procedures
- Use Convex real-time subscriptions, not polling
- Access environment variables only through validated config objects

## Testing

### Testing Standards

**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test-Organization]

- Component tests: `tests/components/`
- API tests: `tests/api/`
- E2E tests: `e2e/`

**Testing Frameworks** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Testing-Pyramid]

- Frontend: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Backend: Vitest + Convex test utilities
- E2E: Playwright

**Specific Testing Requirements**

- Test authentication flow with Convex Auth
- Test form validation and submission
- Test user role management
- Test contact creation and storage
- E2E test for complete user signup and lead capture flow
